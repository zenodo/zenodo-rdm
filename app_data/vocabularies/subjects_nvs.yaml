      in the field. Includes parameters used to determine resistivity structure for
      shallow sediment properties, porosities and presence of hydrocarbon (CSEM),
      deeper crust and mantle studies (Magnetotellurics) and ore body location (polarisation).

    definition: Concentrations of total, organic and inorganic carbon per unit weight
      of sediment.  Sediment is understood to be the solid phase of the bed, including
      the recently settled material sometimes known as fluff collected from the bed
      surface.
