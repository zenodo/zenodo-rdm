    title: Biodiversity Literature Repository
    description: "A community to share publications related to bio-systematics. The goal is to provide 1. open access to publications cited in publications or in combination with scientific names 2. open access FAIR data with focus on taxon treatments and figures liberated from publications 3. a digital object identifier (DOI) to enable citation of the publications and data including direct access to its digital representation. For additional search functionality can be used. This includes also searches in CrossRef, DataCite, PubMed, RefBank, GNUB and Mendeley."
    curation_policy: "If an uploaded document has an existing DOI, it will be kept. If there is no DOI, a Zenodo DOI will be minted for the item. Items with Open Access remain Open Access. Items with closed access remain closed. If they are published on 31.12.1999 or earlier, they are made accessible for reading. Please consult your national copyright law for conditions of reuse. To upload publications, please contact info@plazi.org."

    title: Astronomy Thesis Collection
    description: "This community, curated by astronomy librarians, aims to bring together astronomy and astrophysics theses and dissertations. Share the full-text of your cumulative, graduate or PhD level, research with the world by uploading it as open-access to this subject based community. Once added to the community, it can be indexed by ADS, searched for on Zenodo, and browsed to in the community page. The ADS indexes this community once a month."
    curation_policy: "This collection includes theses and dissertations written to complete Masters or PhD requirements on topics in the fields of astronomy and astrophysics. Other publication types and topics will not be accepted; however, documents that supplement your thesis, such as data sets or videos, are welcome. Although Zenodo accepts all file formats, PDF is strongly preferred for publication submissions. Theses and dissertations written in any language will be accepted, but the metadata record should be created in English. If the NASA ADS has already indexed your thesis, provide us the Bibcode in the Alternate Identifier field before submitting the document."
    page: "This thematic, community-wide repository curated by astronomy librarians and indexed by the NASA ADS collocates theses and dissertations on astronomy and astrophysics. Even if the ADS already lists your dissertation, you can provide open access to a free, full-text, online version of your own work. Browse the collection on https://zenodo.org/collection/user-astrothesis. Upload your thesis on https://zenodo.org/deposit/?c=astrothesis. For detailed instructions on contributing see:our short video walk-through https://youtu.be/g1fHHJoyp3M or our written walk-through http://wolba.ch/gazette/walk-through-contribute-to-the-astronomy-thesis-collection. Points to Remember! Include your ADS bibcode as "is alternate identifier" in the Related/alternate identifies tab near the bottom. Upload a machine readable PDF (use a tool like Acrobat to OCR if necessary). Know and enter your DOI (Digital Object Identifier). Your institution may have issued one. Enter your DOI in the space provided. Publication date is the year your thesis was accepted. Your Affiliation is your awarding university. The Description field is for your abstract. Use the Thesis tab to list your awarding university and to give credit to your supervisor. For Keywords, use the http://astrothesaurus.org/thesaurus/alphabetical-browse Unified Astronomy Thesaurus. The default http://creativecommons.org/choose. Creative Commons Attribution license allows the ADS to use the full-text of your thesis for searching. Enter the References from your Works Cited section into the references tab individually. This is a nice, but optional step. Include related material (e.g. datasets), by providing their ID and an appropriate description on a new line within Related/alternate identifiers tab."

    curation_policy: "Contributions are accepted from participants that presented invited plenary session reviews, contributed plenary session talks, and contributed posters. In addition, individual and collective contributions from (parallel) splinter sessions and contributions from the CS19 hack day are welcome. Submission of presentation slides from speakers and full posters are encouraged. PDF versions of these documents are the preferred format for Zenodo contributions to permit the documents to be previewed in a web browser. For maximum impact, a written contribution may be provided with presentation slides and/or a poster to provide greater context. Those wishing to submit a written conference proceeding are encouraged to format the document using the CS19 LaTeX template (available on www.coolstars19.com/contributions.html). There are no page limits to written contributions. Contributions will be checked for the proper metadata.

    description: "This community collects research outputs that may be relevant to the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) or the SARS-CoV-2. Scientists are encouraged to upload their outcome in this collection to facilitate sharing and discovery of information. Although Open Access articles and datasets are recommended, also closed and restricted access material are accepted. All types of research outputs can be included in this Community (Publication, Poster, Presentation, Dataset, Image, Video/Audio, Software, Lesson, Other)."
    curation_policy: "The Coronavirus Disease Research Community - COVID-19 is curated by a selected team of experts nominated by OpenAIRE:http://www.openaire.eu (see list below). Each time a Zenodo user wants to add a record into the community, an email is sent to the curators that will decide whether to include the record or not. Only records that may be relevant to the Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19) or the SARS-CoV-2 should be included in this community. The Community curators are not able to edit records, therefore they may ask the corresponding authors to modify the record metadata when necessary, to provide the readers/users with more detailed information according to the FAIR principle of Open Science. If after its acceptance, a record is subsequently found not to be compliant, we reserve the right to remove it from the community. The curation team is reachable through the following email address for further clarification or information:covid19@openaire.eu mailto:covid19@openaire.eu. Curator List:Ilaria Fava, UGOE, Germany; Emma Lazzeri, CNR, Italy; Alessia Bardi, CNR, Italy; Iryna Kuchma, EIFL, Ukraine; Paolo Manghi, CNR, Italy; Wolfram Horstmann, UGOE, Germany. *OpenAIRE http://www.openaire.eu:open access and open science training and support since 2009. OpenAIRE is the largest aggregator of European Commission funded research outputs and beyond, also delivering on-demand services for research communities."
    page: "The recent Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19) outbreak is requiring unseen efforts of collaboration of the scientific community that need to act fast and to share results in an unpredictable manner. In order to facilitate the Scientist efforts, this community was created to collect all research results that could be relevant for the scientific community working on the Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19) and SARS-CoV-2. Although Open Access articles and datasets are recommended, also closed and restricted access material are accepted. All types of research outputs can be included in this Community (Publication, Poster, Presentation, Dataset, Image, Video/Audio, Software, Lesson, Other). When depositing a resource that is linked to other resources (not limited to the records deposited in Zenodo but also in other repositories), please make sure that your record is linked to all the other related elements already available, in order to adhere to the FAIR principles of Open Science to maximise the reusability of research results."
